	<h2>Bio</h2>

	<p> 
	Hi! I'm Jensen. I am currently a senior here at Siena College. After graduation I plan to work at SKS Bottle & Packaging in Saratoga Springs as a part 	of their e-commerce department with their marketing team. I have a little brother 	named Carson who also attends Siena and is a Sophomore Sports Communications Major. When I was a sophomore I was lucky enough to be apart of the first Franciscan Pilgrimage class that took 28 students to Italy with Father Mark and Brother Ed.

	Right now my biggest goals are to finish out college strong graduating college maintaining good grades and be able to begin paying off my student loans off comfortably. On a nonprofessional note I also want to own a French Bulldog someday.
